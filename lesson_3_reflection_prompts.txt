1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when other people are involved or when I want to access the repository from different locations (computers).

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

diff with the repository will no longer show your changes, but show the changes against a modified remote.
