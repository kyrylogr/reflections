1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when other people are involved or when I want to access the repository from different locations (computers).

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

diff with the repository will no longer show your changes, but show the changes against a modified remote.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is copy of someones repository that refers to the original and made on github. 
Clone is a complete copy of repository repote or local. 
Branch is a term withing the repository that labels line of commits that diverge from the master branch or other branch.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can see the differences with the actual (latest) version, merge with it if you have a different branch before commiting and pushing, or do the changes that will not bring conflicts
with existing state of remote.
